After collecting the data for the resource utilization, it can be seen that LUT resources are much more in demand then flip-flops, but this can not be compared against Huang, et. al.'s implementation. However, the trends show that the Tagged Up/Down sorter does better than the min-heap in almost all cases and better than the state-of-the-art implementations for smaller queue sizes. In addition, the Tagged Up?Down sorter scales better than the min-heap, but both of the state-of-the-art solutions scale even better.
