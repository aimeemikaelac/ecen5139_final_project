\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, I have presented a short evaluation of the Tagged Up/Down sorter priority queue in comparison to some other priority queue implementations. From this evaluation, it can be seen that this implementation is generally faster than the current state-of-the-art implementations, and is more scalable than a basic min-heap design. However, the state-of-the-art designs are much more scalable, and it is likely that this is the reason that this queue is not used in practice. However, some future work is needed for a complete evaluation of this implementation. First, a more thorough evaluation against a correctly implemented baseline should be performed to get performance numbers for multiple queue sizes. Second, the state-of-the-art implementations need to be implemented to get experimental performance and resource utilization results for evaluation. Only with these additional steps can this evaluation be completed in full.
